 ##  American Sign Language 
  
## üìù Description
- The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) indicates that the 200-year-old American Sign Language is a complete, complex language (of which letter gestures are only part) but is the primary language for many deaf North Americans. Therefore, to build a system that can recognise sign language will help the deaf and hard-of-hearing better communicate using modern-day technologies. In this article, we will go through different architectures of CNN and see how it performs on classifying the Sign Language.
