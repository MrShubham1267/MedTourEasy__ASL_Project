### MedTourEasy_Deep learning Project
 ##  American Sign Language 
- This repository represents **" Action Recognition Using Alphapose "**.
- With the help of this project we can detect the human Actions/Activities based on the **Human Pose**.
  
## üìù Description
- This implemantation is based on official **Alphapose** repository https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose 
- In this project we have used **Alphapose** and **XGBOOST** for activity recognition.

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- Download the dataset for Kaggle
